    "text": "A lot of your research is focused on adolescents; is there a reason for that?\nYes, I intentionally decided to dedicate my research efforts to adolescents and children, more broadly. I believe, for several reasons, that children are understudied relative to their adult counterparts and that this should not be the case. I also believe that as a researcher I should try to make the world a better place for future generations. In my eyes, there is no better way to do that than by trying to keep children happy and healthy. Through my research I try to identify the specific challenges facing children, so that others may better be able to remedy them."

I have only lived in Mississippi for the last couple of years while attending graduate school, but I have thoroughly enjoyed my time here. I am originally from Schwenksville, PA, which is a small suburb of Philadelphia. I lived there until I moved to Memphis, TN to attend Rhodes College.\nWhile I am not originally from Mississippi, it is the focus of much of my research because there are many strong, clear health challenges that face the state, and I want to do the best that I can to help address them."

    "text": "To properly provide you with my motivation for this post I am going to begin in a way that may come across as arrogant, but, to me, it is rather embarrassing. Recently, I have become aware that I have, historically, not dedicated myself to learning content in a life-changing, long-term manner, and have simply been relying on my natural pattern-recognition and problem-solving skills to go through schooling. This has been a decent strategy for me, as I have always performed fairly well. The problem, however, is that this using this approach means that I have never learned how to properly study and actually learn. Consequently, I have forgotten many of the basic ideas and concepts with which I should be well-acquainted. The plan outlined in this post is my attempt to try and remedy this problem. Hopefully, it proves useful for you as well."
