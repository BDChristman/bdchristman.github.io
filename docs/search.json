I believe, for several reasons, that children are understudied relative to their adult counterparts and that this should not be the case. I also believe that as a researcher I should try to make the world a better place for future generations. In my eyes, there is no better way to do that than by trying to keep children happy and healthy. Through my research I try to identify the specific challenges facing children, so that others may better be able to remedy them."

Biostatistics is a fairly difficult topic to relate to, especially if you are just hearing about it for the first time. And let’s be honest, it is almost impossible to hear someone say “I’m getting a PhD in biostatistics and data science”, or any of its variations, and not think they are just a wee bit full of themselves.\nWith all that being said, I would like to attempt to make biostatistics more relatable. So, I am going to share my motivation for choosing this field and why I absolutely love what I do.\nBefore I start, I would like to share an article that was just written by my university that discusses my journey to biostatistics and Mississippi. (The irony is not lost on me; I realize that sharing this does me no good in trying to combat the pomposity claims).\nNow, let’s get started!"

    "text": "A lot of your research is focused on adolescents; is there a reason for that?\nYes, I intentionally decided to dedicate my research efforts to adolescents and children, more broadly. I believe, for several reasons, that children are understudied relative to their adult counterparts and that this should not be the case. I also believe that as a researcher I should try to make the world a better place for future generations. In my eyes, there is no better way to do that than by trying to keep children happy and healthy. Through my research I try to identify the specific challenges facing children, so that others may better be able to remedy them."

I have only lived in Mississippi for the last couple of years while attending graduate school, but I have thoroughly enjoyed my time here. I am originally from Schwenksville, PA, which is a small suburb of Philadelphia. I lived there until I moved to Memphis, TN to attend Rhodes College.\nWhile I am not originally from Mississippi, it is the focus of much of my research because there are many strong, clear health challenges that face the state, and I want to do the best that I can to help address them."
