On this page you will find my answers to some questions that I am commonly asked. If there are any other questions that you think I should add to this page, please email me and let me know!

## What do you do for a living? 

I am a full-time biostatistician and third-year doctoral student in biostatistics and data science at the [University of Mississippi Medical Center](https://www.umc.edu) in the Department of Preventive Medicine and the Department of Data Science, respectively. Prior to starting my current position, I was employed as an independent statistical consultant for the [Mississippi Public Health Institute](https://msphi.org) and as a graduate assistant in the Department of Preventive Medicine to work with the [Mississippi School-based Telehealth Program](https://www.umc.edu/Healthcare/Telehealth/Schools/Home.html).



## What are your research interests?

My research interests are quite varied, as you could probably gather. I am broadly interested in research in longitudinal studies/methods, survey methodology, missing data methods, experimental design, cardiometabolic health, psychology, pediatrics, and the intersections of each of these topics. 


## What are your career goals?

Upon graduating from my Ph.D. program I would like to do a postdoctoral fellowship. This is because I would like to gain more experience and further develop my academic interests prior to applying for faculty positions. I, ultimately, would like to become a professor because I thoroughly enjoy teaching and passing on my love for statistics and science to others. If you have any advice for me on how to best accomplish either of these goals, please reach out!      

## Are you open to opportunities?

I am always open to new experiences. If you are interested in collaborating with me, having me deliver a presentation/seminar, or , please feel free to reach out!
