On this page you will find my answers to some questions that I am commonly asked. If there are any other questions that you think I should add to this page, please email me and let me know!

## What do you do for a living?

I am a full-time biostatistician in the Department of Preventive Medicine at the [University of Mississippi Medical Center](https://www.umc.edu), where I am also a third-year doctoral candidate in Biostatistics and Data Science. I was previously employed as an independent statistical consultant for the [Mississippi Public Health Institute](https://msphi.org) and as a graduate assistant in the Department of Preventive Medicine through a grant funded by the Mississippi Department of Education for my work with the [Mississippi School-based Telehealth Program](https://www.umc.edu/Healthcare/Telehealth/Schools/Home.html).


## A lot of your research is focused on adolescents; is there a reason for that?

Yes, I intentionally decided to dedicate my research efforts to adolescents and children, more broadly. I believe, for several reasons, that children are understudied relative to their adult counterparts and that this should not be the case. I also believe that as a researcher I should try to make the world a better place for future generations. In my eyes, there is no better way to do that than by trying to keep children happy and healthy. Through my research I try to identify the specific challenges facing children, so that others may better be able to remedy them.

## A lot of your research is focused on Mississippi; are you from there?

No, I am not from Mississippi. I have only lived in Mississippi for the last couple of years while attending graduate school, but I have thoroughly enjoyed my time here. I am originally from [Schwenksville, PA](https://www.schwenksville-pa.org), which is a small suburb of Philadelphia. I lived there until I moved to [Memphis, TN](https://www.memphistn.gov) to attend [Rhodes College](https://www.rhodes.edu).

While I am not originally from Mississippi, it is the focus of much of my research because there are many strong, clear health challenges that face the state, and I want to do the best that I can to help address them. 

## What are your research interests?

My research interests are quite varied, as you could probably gather. I am broadly interested in research in longitudinal studies/methods, survey methodology, missing data methods, experimental design, cardiometabolic health, psychology, pediatrics, and the intersections of each of these topics. 


## What are your career goals?

Upon graduating from my Ph.D. program I would like to do a postdoctoral fellowship. This is because I would like to gain more experience and further develop my academic interests prior to applying for faculty positions. I, ultimately, would like to become a professor because I thoroughly enjoy teaching and passing on my love for statistics and science to others. If you have any advice for me on how to best accomplish either of these goals, please reach out!      

## Are you open to opportunities?

I am always open to new experiences. Thus, if you are interested in collaborating with me, having me deliver a presentation/seminar, or hiring me, please feel free to reach out!
