# Background

# Building the Structural Framework

## Download Julia

I hope that it comes as no surprise that to program in Julia we must first have it downloaded onto our computer. To do this, click here on ["Julia"](https://julialang.org/downloads/), find your operating system (Windows, MacOS, etc.) in the table shown below, and download the corresponding installation file.

Then, access the file you have just downloaded and proceed with the prompted installation process. 

And...poof! Julia is now installed on your computer. But, now what?

We need to install an integrated development environment (IDE) to more easily program in Julia. Our weapon of choice will be Visual Studio Code aka VS Code. 

## Install VS Code

Click here on ["VS Code"](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), find your operating system (Windows, MacOS, etc.) among the options listed below, and download the corresponding installation file.

Then, access the file you have just downloaded and proceed with the prompted installation process. 

Now you have both VS Code and Julia installed on your computer! However, we are not quite ready to start programming in Julia. There are a couple more things that we need to do. 

## Install Extensions

Go ahead and start/open VS Code. To access *Extensions* you have two options. First, you can select the *View* tab and then choose *Extensions* or second, you can select the *Extensions* icon on the lefthand side of VSCode (shown below). In *Extensions*, type in and select "julia" (no quotation marks), and then click the *Install* button.

We now have Julia setup and ready to go in VSCode!

Before we continue, we are going to install another extension. This step is optional, but highly recommended. Go back to *Extensions* and type in, select, and install "quarto" (no quotation marks). 

Our structural framework is now complete and we can actually begin our Julia programming journey!

```{julia}
import Pkg
let
    pkgs = ["XLSX", "DataFrames", "Plots", "StatsBase", "IJulia", "GLM"]
    for pkg in pkgs
        if Base.find_package(pkg) === nothing
            Pkg.add(pkg)
        end
    end
end
```

## Import and Clean the Data

```{julia}
#| output: false
using DataFrames, CSV, XLSX

Data = DataFrame(CSV.File("/Users/brianchristman/Desktop/Projects/POMS/POMS_Clean.csv"))
Data1 = DataFrame(XLSX.readtable("/Users/brianchristman/Desktop/Projects/POMS/POMS.xlsx", "Latest Data with Specialty"))
```
